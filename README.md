# Advent Of Code 2021

This is my code for the 2021 Advent Of Code. I've included commits from when I first get the solution and then clean up the code afterwards to optimize things and improve readability. The three primary languages I will be moving between to keep things fresh are Java, C++, and C. Generally I'm most proficient in Java however since the global leaderboard is soo competitive I might as well have some fun with other languages.
